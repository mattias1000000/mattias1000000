I'm building **[Compensara](https://compensara.com)** — the first end-to-end agentic compensation platform. We help companies ditch outdated spreadsheets and black-box benchmarks to make confident, transparent salary decisions.

> ✨ Think: compensation intelligence with superpowers, built by people who *actually* get HR.
